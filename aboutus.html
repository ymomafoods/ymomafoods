                        She has also worked her way into marketing. She has extensive experience volunteering in hospitals and retirement homes engaging with people who suffer from different types of illnesses. Her personal experience in watching her parents decline in the later years of their life due to debilitating illnesses while unable to enjoy eating the foods they have loved all their lives strengthened her resolve to help people have a zest for life. Since food plays an important role in providing this zest in life she decided to navigate into the health food driven landscape. </span>

                <br>
                
            <p>As people live longer, it is imperative that we focus on quality of life. Food is a fundamental pillar of quality of life (QoL), influencing every major domain from physical health and mental well-being to social connection and economic stability.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> Look no further than YMoMa to satisfy your taste buds without compromising on health and wellness. 
            You can eat our foods without worrying about negative effects on health because it's less processed, 
            retaining minerals like iron, magnesium, and potassium, and has a lower glycemic index (GI), 
            leading to slower sugar spikes, making it more beneficial for digestion and blood sugar control, 
            though it's still sugar and should be consumed in moderation.

                <h1>Mission</h1>
                <br>
                <p>YMoMa Foods will follow the ancient Tamil rule உணவே மருந்து, மருந்தே உணவு which simply translates  to 
                    Food is Medicine, Medicine is Food. YMoMa foods will concentrate on foods and snacks that will keep people not just healthy but happyily 
                    satiated. </p>
             <br>
             <p> In a world that never slows down—where meals are rushed, convenience is king, and wellness is too often an afterthought—YMOMA rises with intention. We create uncompromising, nutrient‑rich, minimally processed delights for those who demand more from what they put into their bodies. This is food crafted with integrity, designed for the pace of modern life yet rooted in the values of real nourishment. No shortcuts. No dilution. No compromise. A rebellion against the ordinary.  A new standard for modern nourishment. This is the movement. This is YMOMA.
